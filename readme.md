This project is developed in C++ to carry out the basic payroll management functions,
along with some new features not available in traditional Employee Payroll Management System.
Some of those features are separate Login id password for different employees,
System generated Employee id for new employees, and Manager can promote any employee, he/she can remove any employee,
can add new posts in company, can edit salary for each designation that will be updated in all
those employees who are on the same designation, viewing employees in different order.
The system developed has basic features of employee profile management.
Employee themselves can update their personal details except their pay, which is obviously in control of manager.

NOTE:
Password for manager is gandhi
Password for most employees in the files is qwerty
If you want to have your new, empty employee record then dont use the files- cat.dat,empl.dat provided in the repository ;it will create on its own.
